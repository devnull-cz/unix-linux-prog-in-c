<h2><a name="syllabus">Syllabus</a></h2>

<p>We follow <a href="syllabus.html">this syllabus.</a>  The schedule may slip
during the semester though.

<h2><a name="materials">Materials</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>The primary material for this lecture are <a
  href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c/releases/latest">the
  commented slides.</a>
  <li><a
  href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c/releases/latest">Slides
  as used during the lectures</a>.  They are part of the commented slides so you
  will probably not need them.
  <li>See opening slides for recommended materials for further study.
  <li>An extensive list of recommended and not recommended materials can be
  found on <a href="http://tjn.fjfi.cvut.cz/~virius/liter/litCpp.htm">Miroslav
  Virius's page.</a> Mr. Virius teaches C/C++ at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences
  and Physical Engineering in Prague.
  <li>Online access to the <a
  href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-src">C source code
  files used during the lectures.</a>  Often not complete, and may contain bugs
  on purpose.  Read comments carefully.  You can download tarred achives in <a
  href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-src/releases">releases</a>.
  <li><a href="http://mff.devnull.cz/vim-tips.html">Some ViM tips</a> for
  editting and navigating C source code files.  <li>Information on the
  recommended <a
  href="https://devnull-cz.github.io/unix-linux-prog-in-c/cstyle.html">C
  style</a> for writing code so that fellow programmers can read it as well.
</ul>

<h2><a name="unix_access">Unix machine access</a></h2>

<p><a name="unix_access"> </a><a
href="unix-access.html">See here.</a>

<h2><a name="exams">Exams</a></h2>

<p>The exam schedule will be provided at the end of the semester.  We hope exams
can be held in person but we will adjust accordingly based on the Covid-19
situation at the time.

<p><a href="exams.html">Exam rules</a>.

<h2><a name="practices">Labs</a></h2>

<p>Assignments from the individual lab classes: 
<a href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-labs">unix-linux-prog-in-c-labs@github</a>

<h2><a name="final_assignment">Final Lab Assignment</a></h2>

<p>The final lab assignment you need to implement to get credits for the
labs (which is a hard dependency for entering the credits that you get for
passing the exam into the school information system).

The specification and basic set of tests will be provided before the end of October 2023.
<!--  
  is 
<a href="./class-assignments/labs-assignment-2023.md">a simple MQTT broker</a>.
-->
  
<p>The assignment is a home project and we require a GitHub link (or a
link to a similar hosting site supporting either Git or Mercurial) to your
implementation when you hand it over.  When you are done, send the link
via e-mail (see <a href="#contact">Contact</a> below).

<p><b>It is an individual, not a team project.  In your source code files, you
are not allowed to use code written by anybody else than you.  The idea is you
learn by coding your own project.</b>

<!--
<p>See <a href="./class-assignments/extra-feedback.txt">extra feedback</a> based
on what other students already handed over before you send it.
-->  

<!--
<p>Assignment verification tests are provided in <a
href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-labs/tree/master/final-assignment-tests/shell">https://github.com/devnull-cz/unix-linux-prog-in-c-labs/tree/master/final-assignment-tests/shell</a>.
-->
  
<p><b>You must pass the tests before handing over your solution.</b>  
Note that we will build your program and verify the
tests at least on one of the Linux machines u-pl* in the MFF UK lab at
Mal&aacute; Strana.  Which one should not matter as their configuration is
expected to be identical.  See <a href="#unix_access">Unix machine access</a>
above for more information.  So, that means it is up to you what
Unix-like system you choose to develop your program on but you must be able to
build it and verify the tests on a <code>u-pl*</code> machine as well.

<p>
<table bgcolor="lightgreen">

<td>
<p>The assignment must be finished and handed over via e-mail before the
examination period for the Summer semester starts, i.e. by <b>Monday 23:59, May
27, 2024, CET</b>.  You need to send the e-mail before the deadline.  The date
stands even if the semester is prolonged.

<p>The deadline is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_limit">hard
requirement</a> so stick to the schedule.
Late arrivals are not accepted and handing over late automatically means 
you are not eligible for the credits for the year.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>You can hand over the assignment anytime before the deadline.
This can be useful esp. if you need to finish your semester earlier
(that may apply to Erasmus students).
