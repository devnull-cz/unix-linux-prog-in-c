<li>
What is affected by <tt>LD_PRELOAD</tt> and <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment variables ?
Why it is not good idea to use <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> environment variable for anything
else other than debugging purposes ?
</li>
</ol>

What is the difference between process and thread ?
</li>

<li>
Explain the terms <i>library function</i> and <i>system call</i>.
Describe the convention/semantics of return values of library calls and
system calls.
</li>

<li>
What do the contents of files <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> and <tt>/etc/group</tt> look like ?
When and how are the data stored in these files used in the UNIX system ?
</li>

What objects in UNIX are accessible via file system interface ?
What is the difference between character and block device ?
</li>

<li>
Describe structure of S5 volume and its extensions (ufs).

<li>
Explain the principle of navigating the directory structure, i.e. how does kernel
find data blocks of given file using its path ?
Explain the difference between <i>hardlink</i> and <i>symlink</i>>.
</li>

<li>
What are access rights for files ? What is set UID ?
</li>

<li>
How do processes access open files ? What is the difference between descriptor and
opening of a file ?

<li>
Draw and describe state diagram of a process.
</li>

<li>

Describe the mechanism of maping files into memory. Describe how a process
can access variables and functions in shared library during runtime.
How are these 2 things related together ?
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Signals</h2>

<ol>
<li>
What are signals ? How can be signal generated for a process ?
What is the difference between sending signal to process and to a thread.
</li>

<li>
What are the options for handling a signal ? How is it (blocking, handling) set up for
process and for threads ?
</li>

<li>
What are the rules for writing signal handlers ? How can one cope with restrictions
for their implementation ?
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Threads</h2>

<ol>
<li>
What is a theead and how does it differ from a process ? What attributes are
common for process and which are private for a thread ? How can one create
global variable for a thread ?
</li>

<li>
Describe the process for creating and destroying a thread ? How do the desctructors
of keyed values and exit handlers work ?
</li>

<li>
List synchronization primitives for threads. Describe the way of using
condition variables, reasons for using them in certain way (w.r.t. order of locking)
and what could happen if this was not abided.
</li>

<li>
What are the ways of solving synchronization arithmetic operation (adding and subtraction)
between threads and list their advantages and disadvantages.
</li>

<li>
What happens if one thread calls <tt>fork()</tt> ? What problem this could lead to
and how to solve it ?
</li>
</ol>

for connected network services.
</li>

<li>
Describe workings of server and client (in terms of sequence of system calls)
for datagram network services.
</li>

<li>
What is a socket ? What are the variants of addressing sockets (within single system
and over the network). What functions can be used for conversion from numeric
and string representation (and vice versa) of protocols, ports and IP addresses ?
Why do the functions for converting from local and network byte order have to be used ?
