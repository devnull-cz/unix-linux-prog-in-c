<h2>Exams</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You don't need the credit from labs in order to attempt the exam.
If you did not attend the labs, be sure to check that your Unix lab account
works (try to sign in using SSH). Same for your own laptop.
</p>

<h3>Dates</h3>

<p>
The dates of exams will be in the information system.
<b>
Be sure to check any updates in the information system in the News section
the day before the exam.
</b>
There will be sufficient number of dates.
</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>
You should be able to make your program work with using terminal,
compiler toolchain (<tt>gcc</tt>,
<tt>make</tt>, <tt>ld</tt>, ...) and editor <tt>vim</tt> (<tt>vi</tt>).
If an IDE of choice happens not to be working is not an excuse.
Feel free to use your laptop.
</p>

<h3><a name="rules">Rules</a></h3>

<tr><td>
<p>
You need to sign up for the exam in the Information system. If you cannot make
it once signed up, <b>it is necessary to cancel the sign up until 22:00
the day before the exam</b> (the systsem does not allow it after that)
<b>If you fail to show up it will be considered as a failed attempt</b>.
You can sign up anytime.
</p>
</table>

<p>
There is a practical and oral examination. The duration of the practical part 
is around 2.5 hours. The goal is to produce short fully working program using
Unix API.  It is permitted to use any books or materials (slides and notes from
the lecture, examples, books, man pages, web including search engines etc.)
<b>However, it is strictly prohibited to interact with any other person via any
means of communication.</b>

<p>Oral examination has 2 parts:

<ol>
<li><b>review of the program.</b> Do not forget to use <tt>-Wall</tt>,
C style and check return values of ,,important'' syscalls (e.g. <tt>open</tt>).
Checking return values such as those for mutex lock/unlock is not necessary.
In other words if you know what you are doing, you can omit some checks.
</li>

<li><b>theory</b> (2 questions + additional question if in doubt).
No tools allowed.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>
If the program does not work according to the instructions, it means failed
attempt. Otherwise the quality of the implementation sets the evaluation
of the first part of the exam.
</p>

<p>
Pet peeves (failing to heed these means worsened evaluation)
</p>

<ul>
<li>IPv4/IPv6 agnosticity (program must transparently work in both address
faimilies, should not have hardcoded structures or functions specific
for an address family)</li>
<li>safe signal handlers (either use async-signal-safe functions or
control variables with appropriate declaration)</li>
<li>check return values with appropriate reaction</li>
<li>no active waiting (no spinning where not absolutely necessary)</li>
<li>resource leaks (memory, file descriptors, in-kernel resources -
mainly for SVR4 IPC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The evaluation of the oral exam is based on answers to 2 questions.  If the
resulting evaluation is worse than C (i.e. &gt; 3), it means a failed attempt.
</p>

<p>The overall evaluation is composed from the evaluation of the program and
oral exam. <b>Both need to be max C (= 3).</b> If there is any doubt, the oral
examination will decide.
